# 📘 Math Made Easy

_"To learn math, do math!"_

This is my website that supports my YouTube channel with **math tutoring and lessons**.  
I cover material for **Grades 9–12** and also provide extra support for students preparing for the **Grade 12 entrance exam**.

🔹 The website is updated regularly to highlight **daily focus areas, practice problems, and key exam tips**.  
🔹 Use it as a companion resource alongside the video lessons on my channel.
